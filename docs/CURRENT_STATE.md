## Product and roadmap boundary

Be Community is a multi-tenant BI and data-storytelling platform for an
education-sector consultancy. It begins when raw research data already exists;
it is not a CRM, survey-capture system, or replacement for Excel/Forms.

The V2 construction order remains:

1. P0 security hardening
2. P1 canonical calculation layer
3. P2 universal ingestion
4. P3 template framework
5. P4 advanced BI
6. P5 client portal and longitudinal memory
7. P6 visual backoffice
8. P7 full hardening, adversarial suites, backups and incident response

Do not change that priority because of an incidental feature question. In
particular, retention UI and separate CEO/employee permission tiers are not the
current task. Business content and named starter templates belong to V2.5 and
must use documented authoritative definitions rather than invented rules.

## Verified source and deployment baseline

- Current `main`: `e67e4adc2542c0a2993c65f517bf7445eafb83bd`
  (`test(security): complete Suite A — tenant isolation, data scope and least
  privilege (#36)`). Always verify `origin/main` before beginning new work.
- **Milestone deployment baseline — P6 closure:** Worker version
  `0454021a-e307-430b-bb36-27612b5faa0c` (100% traffic at the time of the P6
  closure check). Version IDs are **not permanent identifiers**; confirm the
  current deployment before release work.
- **This file records milestone/baseline deployments only** — phase closures and
  release baselines. Ordinary merges are **not** logged here: their commit-sha →
  Worker-version mapping belongs in the merged pull request's conversation or
  release record, using the post-merge record template in
  [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md). Because a merge to `main` deploys, a commit made
  solely to record a version id would deploy again and immediately invalidate the
  value it recorded. Never open a documentation PR for that purpose.
- Beta URL (production alias of the synthetic beta Worker
  `becommunity-v1`): `https://becommunity-v1.ollinagencyllc.workers.dev`
- The connected Supabase project contains **synthetic test data only**. This is
  not yet the separate real-client production environment required at go-live.
- **Observed behavior indicates that merges to `main` rebuild and deploy this
  synthetic beta Worker automatically** (PR #29 was documentation-only, no manual
  deployment was performed, and Cloudflare version
  `2a508633-b985-474a-bc2d-e1ddf38a6c79` appeared afterward at 100%). The
  Cloudflare Git-integration settings have not been read directly through
  configured read-only tooling. Therefore **merge approval is deployment
  approval**: every PR needs its full pre-merge gates and human approval before
  merge, then one bounded post-merge health/smoke check — no retriggers, bursts,
  or polling loops. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).
- Supported roles today: `internal` and `client`. CEO and employee test accounts
  intentionally have the same `internal` permissions; do not claim otherwise.

Never place passwords, service-role keys, cookies, tokens, or connection-string
passwords in this document, commits, PR descriptions, screenshots, or logs.

## Completed framework

P0-P6 capabilities are implemented, including:

- forced RLS and least-privilege client reads;
- server-side authorization and tenant/publication boundaries;
- CSV/XLSX ingestion, mapping, preview, atomic commit and rollback;
- canonical calculations and documented rounding policy;
- template save/instantiate framework with copy semantics;
- live filters, guarded pivot, data-connected journey and qualitative review;
- server-generated authenticated PDF reports;
- longitudinal and narrative client views with per-user data scopes;
- client/user backoffice, study configurator, tenant branding and internal
  client preview.

Arquero is a dev-only parity oracle. Production calculation modules must remain
free of runtime code generation. ExcelJS must remain lazy and use its browser
build on the XLSX branch; CSV must never evaluate its Node dependency graph.

## P6E acceptance record

Synthetic acceptance study:

- ID: `ad275928-dbd1-4acf-9de9-fa1623b32a60`
- Tenant A: `298c79c0-a88e-487b-a63d-3d7062c6111e`
- Name: `ACEPTACIÓN P6E — DATOS SINTÉTICOS (TEST)`
- Status: `published` for human visual acceptance
- Import batch: `bd4f26db-093a-4e31-8fa9-de8281300c63` (`committed`)
- Counts: 20 respondents, 80 quantitative responses, 0 qualitative
  observations, 1 import batch

Technical production acceptance completed with **108 checks and 0 failures**:

- deployed CSV and XLSX analyze/preview;
- CSV commit and database reference integrity;
- 77 expected calculation/filter/pivot/journey assertions;
- internal preview and authenticated PDF;
- draft and publication boundaries;
- Tenant A access and Tenant B isolation;
- 41 tailed production requests with no 5xx, uncaught exception,
  `process.umask`, runtime code-generation or Supabase-key error.

The two older `Satisfacción 2026 (TEST)` studies remain draft and must not be
published, modified or deleted during this acceptance work.

## P6 closure record

PR #28 corrected the narrow-mobile min-content overflow and rebalanced the
server PDF into two readable pages without changing calculations, ingestion,
RLS, roles or data. The focused responsive matrix, PDF layout invariants, full
23-gate suite, typecheck, lint and build passed. The accepted production-shaped
PDF retained metric parity and the human reviewer confirmed the real-phone
layout. The PR was squash-merged and the post-merge Worker health check returned
200 with Supabase connected. **P6 is closed.**

## Current task — plan and execute P7 hardening

P7 is the final V2 hardening and go-live-preparedness phase, not a feature
reprioritization. Its acceptance gate is: all adversarial suites A-E green and a
backup restore tested. The complete intended scope is:

- reconcile and run tenant-isolation, authorization, input/injection,
  secrets/supply-chain and edge/auth-resilience suites;
- audit logging for authentication, administrative mutations and imports, plus
  actionable anomaly alerting;
- a backup mechanism suitable for the current tier and a demonstrated restore;
- an incident playbook covering key rotation, session revocation, containment,
  recovery and verification;
- production-branch hygiene and a deliberate deploy strategy;
- monitoring and the remaining Cloudflare/Supabase go-live controls;
- separate production Supabase provisioning and the Pro upgrade trigger before
  any real client receives a link.

Begin with a read-only evidence inventory against the architecture,
`docs/GO_LIVE_SECURITY.md`, `docs/OPERATIONS.md`, current code, migrations,
scripts and live test environment. Produce a phased `docs/P7_PLAN.md` that
separates work executable now from controls blocked on a custom domain, a new
production Supabase project, billing decisions or real-client go-live. Stop for
human review of that plan before implementing P7. Do not create infrastructure,
change credentials, rotate keys, alter production data or enable irreversible
edge controls during the inventory task.

### P7 execution progress

`docs/P7_PLAN.md` is approved. PRs 1-6 are merged and deployed to the synthetic
beta: the evidence plan; Worker identity/deployment discipline; supply-chain,
Suite D and offline CI; executable RLS/FORCE-RLS coverage; the reviewed
adversarial harness; and Suite A.

The merged harness contract remains `docs/P7_HARNESS_DESIGN.md`:

- `scripts/lib/{http-harness,harness-browser,harness-fixtures}.mjs` plus
  `scripts/harness-selftest.mjs` provide the assertion-neutral mechanism;
- mechanisms are frozen per operation; no hashed action IDs, hand-built RSC
  payloads, hidden bypass or runtime fallback is permitted;
- live browser execution uses Linux Chrome from WSL as the ordinary non-root
  user, with sandboxing enabled;
- privileged access is confined to fixture provisioning, bounded metadata
  accounting and exact cleanup; it is never authorization evidence.

Suite A is committed as `scripts/suite-a-isolation.mjs`, executes 16/16 required
controls, and is part of the canonical live release chain. Its final gates
passed; the merge deployed Worker version
`654949b8-649c-4a48-a754-9d4aab7426c0` at 100% traffic. The bounded post-merge
health, logged-out, Tenant A, Tenant B isolation and internal-route smokes all
passed with zero `P7A-`/`P7H-` residue. The commit-to-version record lives in PR
#36's conversation as required by `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

**Current unit:** PR 7, branch `p7f-suites-b-c` — behavioral Suite B
(authorization) and Suite C (hostile input/injection). Both are implemented and
**green on the branch, not yet merged**:

- `npm run suite:b` — 64/64. Its evidence is reported in **three layers that
  are never summed**, because conflating them is how a page-level GET gets
  counted as action coverage:
  1. *catalogue completeness* — one required B1 and B2 row per catalogued
     mutation plus the report route, generated from the frozen catalogue, so a
     new mutation arrives with no result and an unexecuted entry is red;
  2. *outer action route* — one ordinary form-shaped POST to the exact method
     and path each Server Action is dispatched to (no `Next-Action` header, no
     private field, no body), with a positive discriminator and a bare-POST
     405 negative control per path class;
  3. *observable inner Server-Action denial* — only where the application
     actually produces one, which is one operation of eighteen.
  The suite states explicitly that it does **not** claim all eighteen inner
  Server Actions were invoked; they cannot be reached without the hashed action
  identifier or a hand-built RSC body the design forbids.
- `npm run suite:c` — 13/13, including an inert hostile payload carried through
  the real ingestion and human-review workflow and then **positively located**
  in the generated PDF's decoded displayed text as well as in the rendered
  client dashboard. C1.3 fails if the payload is absent, so it can no longer
  pass on a report the quote never reached.
- `npm run gates:live` now runs `test:qualitative-live -> suite:a -> suite:b ->
  suite:c`, each exactly once. `npm test` gains `test:pivot` (previously
  orphaned) and the credential-free Suite B/C self-test, reaching 26 gates.
- Every run restored its exact pre-run object counts and left zero `P7A-`,
  `P7B-`, `P7C-` or `P7H-` residue.

Two behaviors PR 7 measured that a reviewer should read before merging, both
recorded rather than asserted past:

1. **The middleware answers before every per-action guard.** An unauthenticated
   caller is denied on every non-public path — including the POST a Server
   Action travels on — so `internalContext()`, `authorizeInternal()` and the
   report route's own 401 are a real second layer that is shadowed from
   outside. Suite B asserts the denial at whichever gate answered, proves the
   outer boundary on the action route's own POST method and path, and records
   which layer each result came from. This is defense in depth working, not a
   gap. One path class is a stated limitation: `/admin/upload` answers a
   wrong-role caller with HTTP 200 and a rendered denial page rather than a
   status, so no status-level claim is made there and its denial is proven at
   the browser layer instead.
2. **An over-limit upload was refused silently — now corrected in the product.**
   Next truncates the request body at its own cap and the action then throws, so
   the upload action's own `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` check was unreachable and the
   operator saw nothing. PR 7 adds the smallest correction that fixes it:
   `exceedsUploadLimit()` joins the shared validation module and the upload form
   refuses an over-limit source on selection, leaving the analyze control
   disabled. The server-side check is untouched and remains authoritative. C2.3
   now requires a rendered rejection **and** zero dispatch; C2.4 proves an
   ordinary in-limit source is still accepted. **This makes PR 7 no longer
   test-only:** it touches exactly two application files,
   `src/app/admin/upload/UploadForm.tsx` and `src/lib/validation/schemas.ts`,
   both admitted to the structural scope guard by name.

Suite E is still not green. PR 8 and later P7 work must not begin until PR 7 is
reviewed, merged and post-merge verified.

## Known constraints carried forward

- **The lockfile has one authoring version: npm 10.9.2.** It is declared in
  `package.json` (`packageManager`), installed and asserted by CI before
  `npm ci`, and enforced by Suite D's D-f. npm 11 prunes peer nodes beneath
  platform-excluded optional dependencies out of the lockfile; npm 10 — which
  Cloudflare's build image runs — still requires them, so a regeneration under
  npm 11 is green locally and in CI and then stops the deploy build before it
  starts. Regenerate dependencies only under npm 10.9.2.
- **No repository npm lifecycle command runs on the Windows workstation.**
  Smart App Control is enabled there and blocks Cloudflare's unsigned
  `workerd.exe`. This is not confined to `cf:build`: a plain `npm ci` runs
  package lifecycle/install validation that loads that binary, and Windows Code
  Integrity event 3077 recorded three such blocked loads on 2026-08-23 —
  two from disposable install directories and one from the main repository
  `node_modules`. Treat `npm install`, `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run build`,
  `npm run cf:build` and every gate chain as Linux-only. Windows is for editing,
  Git and static inspection. Do not disable Smart App Control and do not attempt
  a per-file bypass.
- **The verifier does not auto-synchronize.** Node/npm verification runs in WSL 2
  Ubuntu (`/home/patop/becommunity-software`, ordinary user `patop`, Node
  24.11.1, npm 10.9.2) or Linux CI.
  Push the exact commit from the Windows editing tree first, then fetch and check
  out that exact remote commit in WSL. The verifier clone must be full-history
  and full-blob: Suite D's D-d proves every reachable blob, which a `blob:none`
  partial clone cannot do.
- **Live browser evidence runs in WSL as a non-root user, with Linux Chrome.**
  The harness self-test requires a real browser (design §3.2, S0), and it must be
  the browser's Linux build inside the distribution, selected with `CHROME_PATH`.
  Run it as an ordinary user rather than root, so the browser sandbox stays on
  and `--no-sandbox` is never needed. **Never launch the Windows Chrome executable
  from WSL:** its DevTools endpoint binds on the Windows side and is unreachable
  from the distribution, and it cannot resolve a Linux profile path, so the run
  fails at S0 with no browser coverage.
- `npm run cf:build` can also fail on Windows with OpenNext's documented symlink
  `EPERM`; Cloudflare's Linux branch build is the authoritative bundle check.
- Local OpenNext output **does** contain inlined environment values:
  `cf:build` writes `.open-next/cloudflare/next-env.mjs` with every variable from
  a local `.env*` file as a literal. `.open-next/` is gitignored; never deploy or
  upload it from a machine with a populated `.env.local`, and purge it after
  checks. `npm run test:secrets` now scans it and fails on exactly this;
  `npm run suite:d` is the full supply-chain gate and runs on Linux CI.
- The current synthetic environment is not the final staging/production split.
- Some P7 controls require decisions or external prerequisites (custom domain,
  production Supabase project, billing/Pro activation). The P7 plan must expose
  these dependencies rather than silently skipping them or treating them as
  already complete.

## Required verification discipline

Use the scripts in `package.json` as the source of truth. At minimum, every PR
must run its focused tests plus:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

Run all of these in WSL or Linux CI, never on the Windows workstation — see
"Known constraints carried forward" above.

Security/release work also runs the applicable live isolation and secret gates.
Never mark an unexecuted check as passed, never alter expected calculations to
make a test green, and never bypass the real application workflow by manually
inserting acceptance rows.
