## Product and roadmap boundary

Be Community is a multi-tenant BI and data-storytelling platform for an
education-sector consultancy. It begins when raw research data already exists;
it is not a CRM, survey-capture system, or replacement for Excel/Forms.

The V2 construction order remains:

1. P0 security hardening
2. P1 canonical calculation layer
3. P2 universal ingestion
4. P3 template framework
5. P4 advanced BI
6. P5 client portal and longitudinal memory
7. P6 visual backoffice
8. P7 full hardening, adversarial suites, backups and incident response

Do not change that priority because of an incidental feature question. In
particular, retention UI and separate CEO/employee permission tiers are not the
current task. Business content and named starter templates belong to V2.5 and
must use documented authoritative definitions rather than invented rules.

## Verified source and deployment baseline

- Current `main`: `2fe76705cf2b98439b37cc6ff9a79c3f147f41d1`
  (`fix(p6): keep the dashboard inside narrow viewports and fit the report into
  two pages (#28)`). Always verify `origin/main` before beginning new work.
- **Milestone deployment baseline — P6 closure:** Worker version
  `0454021a-e307-430b-bb36-27612b5faa0c` (100% traffic at the time of the P6
  closure check). Version IDs are **not permanent identifiers**; confirm the
  current deployment before release work.
- **This file records milestone/baseline deployments only** — phase closures and
  release baselines. Ordinary merges are **not** logged here: their commit-sha →
  Worker-version mapping belongs in the merged pull request's conversation or
  release record, using the post-merge record template in
  [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md). Because a merge to `main` deploys, a commit made
  solely to record a version id would deploy again and immediately invalidate the
  value it recorded. Never open a documentation PR for that purpose.
- Beta URL (production alias of the synthetic beta Worker
  `becommunity-v1`): `https://becommunity-v1.ollinagencyllc.workers.dev`
- The connected Supabase project contains **synthetic test data only**. This is
  not yet the separate real-client production environment required at go-live.
- **Observed behavior indicates that merges to `main` rebuild and deploy this
  synthetic beta Worker automatically** (PR #29 was documentation-only, no manual
  deployment was performed, and Cloudflare version
  `2a508633-b985-474a-bc2d-e1ddf38a6c79` appeared afterward at 100%). The
  Cloudflare Git-integration settings have not been read directly through
  configured read-only tooling. Therefore **merge approval is deployment
  approval**: every PR needs its full pre-merge gates and human approval before
  merge, then one bounded post-merge health/smoke check — no retriggers, bursts,
  or polling loops. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).
- Supported roles today: `internal` and `client`. CEO and employee test accounts
  intentionally have the same `internal` permissions; do not claim otherwise.

Never place passwords, service-role keys, cookies, tokens, or connection-string
passwords in this document, commits, PR descriptions, screenshots, or logs.

## Completed framework

P0-P6 capabilities are implemented, including:

- forced RLS and least-privilege client reads;
- server-side authorization and tenant/publication boundaries;
- CSV/XLSX ingestion, mapping, preview, atomic commit and rollback;
- canonical calculations and documented rounding policy;
- template save/instantiate framework with copy semantics;
- live filters, guarded pivot, data-connected journey and qualitative review;
- server-generated authenticated PDF reports;
- longitudinal and narrative client views with per-user data scopes;
- client/user backoffice, study configurator, tenant branding and internal
  client preview.

Arquero is a dev-only parity oracle. Production calculation modules must remain
free of runtime code generation. ExcelJS must remain lazy and use its browser
build on the XLSX branch; CSV must never evaluate its Node dependency graph.

## P6E acceptance record

Synthetic acceptance study:

- ID: `ad275928-dbd1-4acf-9de9-fa1623b32a60`
- Tenant A: `298c79c0-a88e-487b-a63d-3d7062c6111e`
- Name: `ACEPTACIÓN P6E — DATOS SINTÉTICOS (TEST)`
- Status: `published` for human visual acceptance
- Import batch: `bd4f26db-093a-4e31-8fa9-de8281300c63` (`committed`)
- Counts: 20 respondents, 80 quantitative responses, 0 qualitative
  observations, 1 import batch

Technical production acceptance completed with **108 checks and 0 failures**:

- deployed CSV and XLSX analyze/preview;
- CSV commit and database reference integrity;
- 77 expected calculation/filter/pivot/journey assertions;
- internal preview and authenticated PDF;
- draft and publication boundaries;
- Tenant A access and Tenant B isolation;
- 41 tailed production requests with no 5xx, uncaught exception,
  `process.umask`, runtime code-generation or Supabase-key error.

The two older `Satisfacción 2026 (TEST)` studies remain draft and must not be
published, modified or deleted during this acceptance work.

## P6 closure record

PR #28 corrected the narrow-mobile min-content overflow and rebalanced the
server PDF into two readable pages without changing calculations, ingestion,
RLS, roles or data. The focused responsive matrix, PDF layout invariants, full
23-gate suite, typecheck, lint and build passed. The accepted production-shaped
PDF retained metric parity and the human reviewer confirmed the real-phone
layout. The PR was squash-merged and the post-merge Worker health check returned
200 with Supabase connected. **P6 is closed.**

## Current task — plan and execute P7 hardening

P7 is the final V2 hardening and go-live-preparedness phase, not a feature
reprioritization. Its acceptance gate is: all adversarial suites A-E green and a
backup restore tested. The complete intended scope is:

- reconcile and run tenant-isolation, authorization, input/injection,
  secrets/supply-chain and edge/auth-resilience suites;
- audit logging for authentication, administrative mutations and imports, plus
  actionable anomaly alerting;
- a backup mechanism suitable for the current tier and a demonstrated restore;
- an incident playbook covering key rotation, session revocation, containment,
  recovery and verification;
- production-branch hygiene and a deliberate deploy strategy;
- monitoring and the remaining Cloudflare/Supabase go-live controls;
- separate production Supabase provisioning and the Pro upgrade trigger before
  any real client receives a link.

Begin with a read-only evidence inventory against the architecture,
`docs/GO_LIVE_SECURITY.md`, `docs/OPERATIONS.md`, current code, migrations,
scripts and live test environment. Produce a phased `docs/P7_PLAN.md` that
separates work executable now from controls blocked on a custom domain, a new
production Supabase project, billing decisions or real-client go-live. Stop for
human review of that plan before implementing P7. Do not create infrastructure,
change credentials, rotate keys, alter production data or enable irreversible
edge controls during the inventory task.

## Known constraints carried forward

- `npm run cf:build` can fail on Windows with OpenNext's documented symlink
  `EPERM`; Cloudflare's Linux branch build is the authoritative bundle check.
- Local OpenNext output **does** contain inlined environment values:
  `cf:build` writes `.open-next/cloudflare/next-env.mjs` with every variable from
  a local `.env*` file as a literal. `.open-next/` is gitignored; never deploy or
  upload it from a machine with a populated `.env.local`, and purge it after
  checks. `npm run test:secrets` now scans it and fails on exactly this;
  `npm run suite:d` is the full supply-chain gate and runs on Linux CI.
- The current synthetic environment is not the final staging/production split.
- Some P7 controls require decisions or external prerequisites (custom domain,
  production Supabase project, billing/Pro activation). The P7 plan must expose
  these dependencies rather than silently skipping them or treating them as
  already complete.

## Required verification discipline

Use the scripts in `package.json` as the source of truth. At minimum, every PR
must run its focused tests plus:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

Security/release work also runs the applicable live isolation and secret gates.
Never mark an unexecuted check as passed, never alter expected calculations to
make a test green, and never bypass the real application workflow by manually
inserting acceptance rows.
